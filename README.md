# Masters
Master thesis project in implementing Genetic algortithm to solve mazes.

## Maze

Tree like generation of the maze into Matrix (n*n)

## Genetic Algorithm
Is an optimization algorithms (Greedy Algorithms) with heurestics and a pseude-random mutations into the solve space.
Note : solution is perfect, it will give local minimum/maximum. This is why the solution should be varified multiple times from different starting points.

Terminates only if satisfied from external sources (pre-conditioned)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm#Termination

This solution uses Chromosome represantation in bit set - path takes for the maze matrix


## Unity visualization.

Each ant has a rigidbody and can move only in 2 axis (x,y).
Walls will not let the ant through.
